# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview

To build a visualization model with interactive features on earthquakes around the world. The deliverables for this project are:

Add Tectonic Plate Data.
Add Major Earthquake Data.
Add an Additional Map.

## Results

The earthquake data was collected from the U.S Geological Survey website with information on recent earthquakes worldwide. The map has a circular marker whose color and size matches to the magnitudes of the earthquakes. It has a pop-up field with information of the location and magnitude scale.

Adding the Tectonic Plate information to the map allows us to see the limits of plate boundaries and why they are linked to earthquakes.

The Major Earthquake Data provides information about the events with scale magnitude 5 and over.

A third map option was added to the earthquake data to provide a more options when users explore the information within the map.

## Summary

In the maps we have incorporated factors such as location and magnitude scale relating to earthquakes, giving users good experience in searching and viewing earthquake information around the world, and perhaps with an extra powerful tool with more features regarding population affected, time of the event, and infrastructure damage, would provide much more information as how risks arise with earthquakes so that authorities could be better prepared for future events.
